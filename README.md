# OOP - Assignment
## Description
For this assignment , I was required to create a Sci-Fi User Interface. At first I had many ideas on what to base my assignment on but decided to make a planet finder. I tried to potray the idea that I was in a Spaceship and there was a user interface within it which could be used to find planets around the ship.

## Code
In this assignment I tried to use as many Processing functions as I could. I used these to make the project interactive which in turn would make the project better. I used many different class functions to make the code better, which I find are very useful to eliminate errors in your code. I aslo used loops such as for loops so that I could complete code in a more efficient way and it saved me some time too. I added IF statements to my code that I used for functionality of the buttons.

I started off by developing the body of this user interface. At first I tried to create a hologram-like body which I found difficult to make the body transparent like a hologram, so I just developed a screen instead. When I finished the body I added a radar to locate planets surrounding the ship. I added in 3 speedometer-like objects that have no real function but are there for a bit of jazz. My favourite part was designing the fluctuating bar chart that shows how much energy resources are on the ship. I then added buttons that show the details of a planet that are shown on screen when they are clicked. I wanted to add a path follower in the bottom right corner of the dashboard, that showed the planets orbitting the ship but I found this part hardest.

If I was to do this again I woud definitely allow myself more time so I could have more functionality and so I could have completed the path follower but overall I really enjoyed this assignment.
